# Anomaly Detector

**Anomaly Detector** is a machine learning system designed to identify anomalies in images using color histograms in the HSV color space. This tool is ideal for applications requiring automated anomaly detection in datasets.

## Features
- Load and quantify images from a dataset directory.
- Train an anomaly detection model on the quantified dataset.
- Test new images to predict anomalies.
- Display results with labeled images indicating anomalies.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn
   ```
